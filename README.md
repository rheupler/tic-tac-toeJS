# ${1:TIC TAC TOE}
 Classic tic tac toe game where user tries to get 3 X's or O's in a row.

 BEWARE: Worked on having AI making selection. Were able to get it to insert "O"
 into random empty square.

 Ran into a bug where declared "O" a winner even though there were not three in
 a row. Weren't able to properly troubleshoot yet.

 The functions for AI are all commented out.

 Game is in working condition for 2 players.
